# README-Generator

## Description

For this project we were required to build a README generator from the command line using a series of questions prompting the user to input their answers which will then correspond to the appropriate sections of the README file.

## Installation

The project runs in the command line so to install you would need to copy the files or clone them into VS Code and run the code from there. 

## Usage

The user must first copy the files into their local directory and run the code from their terminal. 

The user must download the Inquirer package.

In the terminal the user must type in 'node index.js' to initialize the questions. The user must then answer all of the questions and after answering all of the questions then the README file will be generated in the output folder.
